# Domain 1: Cloud Concepts (≈ 26%)

## 1. What Is the AWS Cloud & Its Value Proposition
- On-demand compute, storage, and services.
- **Pay-as-you-go (OpEx)** model instead of big upfront CapEx.
- Frees up technical teams to focus on value-generating work.

## 2. Key Benefits of the AWS Cloud
1. **Cost Savings** – No upfront hardware, only pay for usage.  
2. **Speed & Agility** – Rapid provisioning and experimentation.  
3. **Scalability** – Grow resources to meet increasing demand.  
4. **High Availability** – Built-in resilience across Availability Zones.  
5. **Global Reach** – Deploy in multiple geographic Regions quickly.  
6. **Security & Sustainability** – Enterprise-level security and efficient infrastructure.

## 3. Cloud Economics (CapEx vs OpEx & TCO)
- **CapEx:** Buying hardware, data centers, software licenses.  
- **OpEx:** Ongoing pay-as-you-go spending (compute, storage, licensing).  
- Understand **TCO** by including costs like labor, data center operations, maintenance, and power.  
- AWS helps lower TCO via right-sized infrastructure, automation, managed services (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB, ECS/EKS), and reduced compliance burden.

## 4. AWS Architectural Design Principles
- **Design for failure:** Assume components fail—use multi-AZ, backups, retries.
- **Decouple components:** Use queues (SQS), SNS, streams, microservices architecture.
- **Implement elasticity:** Automatically adjust capacity based on load.
- **Think parallel:** Scale with parallel processing (e.g., fan-out, Lambda).
  
## 5. Exam Blueprint Topics (Task Statements)
- Define cloud benefits and architecture principles.  
- Understand migration strategies (e.g., Snowball, database replication).  
- Know rightsizing and automation benefits (e.g., CloudFormation).  
- Recognize managed services and their cost/operational advantages—RDS, ECS, EKS, DynamoDB. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
