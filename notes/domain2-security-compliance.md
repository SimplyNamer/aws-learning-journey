# Domain 2: Security & Compliance (≈ 25–30%)

## 1. AWS Shared Responsibility Model
- **AWS is responsible for security *of* the cloud**  
  (physical infrastructure, hardware, software, networking, facilities).
- **Customer is responsible for security *in* the cloud**  
  (data, access management, OS, firewalls, application configuration).

✅ Exam Tip: Remember the “OF vs IN” distinction.

## 2. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- **IAM Users** → individual identities with credentials.
- **IAM Groups** → collection of users with policies.
- **IAM Roles** → temporary access with permissions (cross-account, EC2, Lambda).
- **Policies** → JSON documents defining permissions (allow/deny).
- **Principle of Least Privilege** → only give the minimum permissions needed.

## 3. Core AWS Security Services
- **AWS Cognito** → Authentication for apps (sign-up/sign-in, federation).  
- **AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)** → Protects against common web exploits (SQL injection, XSS).  
- **AWS Shield** → Managed DDoS protection.  
  - Standard: free  
  - Advanced: paid, more protection  
- **AWS KMS (Key Management Service)** → Encryption keys.  
- **AWS CloudHSM** → Hardware-based key storage.  
- **Amazon GuardDuty** → Threat detection and continuous monitoring.  
- **AWS Inspector** → Automated vulnerability scanning.  
- **AWS Security Hub** → Central dashboard for security/compliance checks.  
- **CloudTrail** → Tracks API calls (who did what, when, from where).  
- **CloudWatch** → Monitoring, logging, and alarms.  

---

## 4. Compliance & Governance
- **AWS Artifact** → Access compliance reports (ISO, SOC, PCI DSS).  
- **AWS Organizations** → Manage multiple accounts, apply **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**.  
- **Trusted Advisor** → Provides best-practice checks for cost, security, fault tolerance, performance.  

---

## 5. Exam Blueprint Focus
- Understand the Shared Responsibility Model.  
- Be able to identify which security service does what (e.g., WAF vs Shield vs GuardDuty).  
- Know IAM basics (users, groups, roles, policies).  
- Recognize compliance resources (Artifact, Trusted Advisor).  
- Identify tools for monitoring and auditing (CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Security Hub).

## 6. Practice Triggers (Keywords to Watch)
- **“Who can access what?”** → IAM  
- **“Block SQL injection”** → WAF  
- **“Protect against DDoS”** → Shield  
- **“Compliance reports”** → Artifact  
- **“Log API calls”** → CloudTrail  
- **“Continuous threat detection”** → GuardDuty
