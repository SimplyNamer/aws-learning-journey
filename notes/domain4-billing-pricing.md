# Domain 4: Billing, Pricing & Support (≈ 12–16%)

## 1. AWS Pricing Principles
- **Pay-as-you-go** → Only pay for the resources you use.  
- **Savings Plans & Reserved Instances** → Reduce cost for long-term usage.  
- **Free Tier** → Limited resources free for 12 months for new accounts.  

### Key Concepts
- **On-demand** → Flexible, no long-term commitment.  
- **Reserved Instances** → Commit 1–3 years for discount.  
- **Spot Instances** → Use unused capacity at steep discount, can be interrupted.  
- **Elasticity & Cost Optimization** → Scale down when not in use to save money.
